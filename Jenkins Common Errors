***********Jenkins Common Errors***********
1. Java Heap Out-Of-Memory Error (Jenkins JVM)
#Out of memory can occur on both Master and Worker nodes. It depends on where the JVM or job is running.
UI dies → Master OOM
Build fails → Worker OOM

Solution: 
Increase JVM heap memory size by modifying JENKINS_JAVA_OPTIONS environment variable (Ex: -Xmx2g for 2GB)
